# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `sudo docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .` build app with Docker and creates the image

#### Nota: para evitar dependencias duplicadas en docker vamos a eliminar los node_modules de nuestro directorio

### `sudo docker images` returns the image that we have recently built

### `docker run -it -p 3000:3000 <IMAGE_ID>` run app in docker

### `sudo docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v /home/node/node_modules -v "$(pwd)":/home/node <IMAGE_ID>` if we want to run in dev with live reload

### `sudo docker run -it <IMAGE_ID> npm run test` run tests inside Docker for CI in Travis

### `sudo docker-compose up --build` run docker image throw Docker Compose

### `sudo docker exec -it <IMAGE_ID> npm run test` execute test inside Docker with life reload

### `sudo docker exec -it <IMAGE_ID> sh` para acceder a uno de los contenedores

### `sudo docker build .` para generar la versión de producción y ejecuitarla en un nginx utilizamos el fichero Dockerfile

### `sudo docker run -p  8080:80 f290a9dbcd4f` ejecutamos la imagen de nuestra aplicación con el nginx y la mostramos en el puerto 8080
